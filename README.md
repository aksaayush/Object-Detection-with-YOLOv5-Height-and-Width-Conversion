# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv5-Height-and-Width-Conversion
This project showcases object detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to detect objects in an image. Additionally, it calculates the height and width of the detected objects in pixel units and provides functionality to convert them to real-world units such as centimeters (cm).

Key Features:
- Utilizes YOLOv5, a popular object detection model, for accurate and efficient object detection.
- Detects objects in an input image and extracts the bounding box coordinates.
- Calculates the height and width of the objects in pixel units.
- Provides flexibility to customize the conversion factor based on the real-world scale or size relationship.
- Converts the height and width from pixel units to real-world units, such as centimeters.
- Outputs the converted height and width measurements for further analysis or application.

How to Use:
1. Install the necessary dependencies, including YOLOv5 and other required libraries.
2. Provide the path or URL to the input image.
3. Run the code to perform object detection and calculate the height and width of the objects in the image.
4. Optionally, adjust the conversion factor to convert the measurements to the desired real-world units.
5. Retrieve the converted height and width measurements for analysis or use in other applications.

This project serves as a foundation for incorporating YOLOv5 object detection into workflows that require accurate height and width measurements in real-world units. It can be extended and customized to suit specific needs, such as integrating with other computer vision tasks or building more complex applications that involve object measurement and analysis.

Enjoy exploring the capabilities of YOLOv5 and leveraging its object detection capabilities to obtain meaningful height and width measurements in real-world units!
