# Object-Detection-with-YOLOv5-Height-and-Width-Conversion
This project showcases object detection using YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, to detect objects in an image. Additionally, it calculates the height and width of the detected objects in pixel units and provides functionality to convert them to real-world units such as centimeters (cm).
